Welcome to Kharon Protocol.

### Kharon aims to power-up businesses and enterprises by connecting blockchains with IoT.  

This is our submission for the Business Hackathon powered by TDeFi.

IoT comes with several  use cases in different sectors, however, its wider application is caught sometimes behind security concerns over data storage or on the device itself. Will combining it with blockchain be the answer to all its woes? Our answer is yes, as the projects trying to tackle these problems surely reflect. But they all come with their set of drawbacks that must be tackled along the way.

Blockchain can Bring to the table Decentralization of data, added Security, which is perhaps one of the greatest woes of IoT. Transparency: as anyone would be able to check the blockchain at any time. Autonomy, as the Blockchain reinforces machine to machine economies through a token. And reduced costs as there are already great projects around with huge infrastructure.

Enter the Kharon project, we aim to bring forth all of the previously discussed benefits by joining IoT and Blockchain, but without the downside.

This is achieved by focusing on Interoperability between blockchains.

Namely the Solana blockchain with its speed and ease of development and the huge infrastructure of the Helium Network with its more than one hundred and eighty thousand LoRa Hotspots around the world.

Kharon provides a way to connect between these two chains, provides Machine to Machine economics through our OBOL token, and several services to businesses and enterprises such as provenance and asset tracking.

Now letâ€™s go to our Demo of Kharon Protocol.

First of all, our page is already online and you can visit it without problem.
The page is deployed with AWS amplify to facilitate its scalability.
Here we have our landing page, which helps us to give general information about the project and direct the user
in the correct way to use our application. It also gives real-time data of the price of Solana and Helium
through the Coinmarketcap API.

You can start the application by clicking on the button in the corner that will take us to the menu to be able to swap between Solana and Helium.
In order to access the services to add IoT devices, we must connect our wallet for security reasons. Thus adding an additional layer of confidence.
After connecting the wallet, we can now see the devices and the last messages of the device.
Now by entering the signature, that will direct us to the Solana Explorer where we can see that indeed the transaction is input into Solana's devnet.


Now we would like to present how a company may use Kharon Protocol for their business in a real use case.

We have a socially responsible blockchain marketplace hosted and live. It will launch in the future and it has all the characteristics of any marketplace including payment systems.

Then we have our Blockchain provenance service. This works with QR codes as you can see and as we scan the product it sends us directly to the blockchain, where we can see all the information we require about said product. We are using the Solana blockchain for this application because of its speed and the fact that it is public so the consumer can check the provenance of the product and keep track of where it has been.

Kharon Protocol is then like a Shopify with Blockchain meets Supply chain with Blockchain, but focused only on interoperability. We are not trying to create infrastructure nor a whole new blockchain. By focusing on only these, we do more!



Now, this kind of application has already reached Several places and markets around the world such as wine, luxury, beauty and others. It is for example heavily deployed by Walmart China.

Our team comes from a diverse background but we now have around 15 years of combined IoT development experience and are exploring the IoT plus blockchain space.
