# Introduction and Problem Statement

IoT comes with several  use cases in different sectors, however, its wider application is caught sometimes behind security concerns over data storage or on the device itself. Will combining it with blockchain be the answer to all its woes? Our answer is yes, as the projects trying to tackle these problems surely reflect. But they all come with their set of drawbacks that must be tackled along the way.

Blockchain can Bring to the table Decentralization of data, added Security, which is perhaps one of the greatest woes of IoT. Transparency: as anyone would be able to check the blockchain at any time. Autonomy, as the Blockchain reinforces machine to machine economies through a token. And reduced costs as there are already great projects around with huge infrastructure.

# Solution

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/sqW7pxN/Gif1.gif" width="400"> 

Enter the Kharon project, we aim to bring forth all of the previously discussed benefits by joining IoT and Blockchain, but without the downside.

This is achieved by focusing on Interoperability between blockchains.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/MsWHqpL/Gif2.gif" width="400">

Namely the Solana blockchain with its speed and ease of development and the huge infrastructure of the Helium Network with its more than one hundred and eighty thousand LoRa Hotspots around the world.

Kharon provides a way to connect between these two chains, provides Machine to Machine economics through our OBOL token, and several services to businesses and enterprises such as provenance and asset tracking.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/MfMQyvg/Gif3-2.gif" width="400">

Now letâ€™s go to our Demo of Kharon Protocol.

First of all, our page is already online and you can visit it without problem.
The page is deployed with Azure DevOps to facilitate its scalability.
Here we have our landing page, which helps us to give general information about the project and direct the user
in the correct way to use our application. It also gives real-time data of the price of Solana and Helium
through the Coinmarketcap API.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/PgrPqJr/1.png" width="49.7%">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/r00G0p5/2.png" width="49.6%">

You can start the application by clicking on the button in the corner that will take us to the menu to be able to swap between Solana and Helium.
In order to access the services to add IoT devices, we must connect our wallet for security reasons. Thus adding an additional layer of confidence.
After connecting the wallet, we can now see the devices and the last messages of the device.
Now by entering the signature, that will direct us to the Solana Explorer where we can see that indeed the transaction is input into Solana's devnet.

# Use Cases

Now we would like to present how a company may use Kharon Protocol for their business in a real use case.

We have a socially responsible blockchain marketplace hosted and live. It will launch in the future and it has all the characteristics of any marketplace including payment systems.

Then we have our Blockchain provenance service. This works with QR codes as you can see and as we scan the product it sends us directly to the blockchain, where we can see all the information we require about said product. We are using the Solana blockchain for this application because of its speed and the fact that it is public so the consumer can check the provenance of the product and keep track of where it has been.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tpHLSyw/image3.png">

Kharon Protocol is then like a Shopify meets Supply chain with Blockchain, but focused only on interoperability. 

We are not trying to create infrastructure nor are we just exporting something from web2 to web3. The IoT Helium network plus Solana through Kharon is 10 times better than incumbents!


Now, this kind of application has already reached Several places and markets around the world such as wine, luxury, beauty and others. It is for example heavily deployed by Walmart China.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/G0t39Wj/valid.png">

## Second use case

Cold storage asset tracking (thinking about vaccines primarily).

COVID-19 hit developing countries very hard, but that creates necessities and thus, new markets. 
In the last two years, Mexico lost one million cubic meters in its storage capacity focused on the cold chain, according to the 2020 GCCA Global Cold Storage Capacity Report.
As a result of this decrease in total cold storage capacity, Mexico also lost capacity in m3 per urban inhabitant, from 0.152 in 2018 to 0.138 in 2020, below the world average of 0.15.

This loss of cold chain storage in Mexico occurs at a time when the country is preparing for the handling and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine -still in the testing phase-, while it has categorically ruled out most of the use of the vaccine developed by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, as it does not have an infrastructure capable of supporting the need to preserve the product at -70 centigrade (deep freezing).

Cold storage and thus, Cold transport and asset tracking is paramount for our "New normal", and even countries like the US and India that are leaders in that regard, have fall short of proper solutions.

According to EY: "The great opportunities in the cold chain for organizations are: growth in capacities, incorporation of disruptive technologies, reducing costs, improving decision-making, ensuring regulatory compliance and staff training."

A decentralized system that can oversee most of these problems and function to growth economics through a token, is an immense disruptor in this regard, we think Kharon can fill that gap.

Again, our demo video for a Cold storage prototype:

# Obol Token 

The OBOL token is the heart of the project as it will be the one that incentivizes the growing adoption of this network through sensors (that will be primarily based around asset tracking, see our Market analysis). It will bring forth Machine to Machine economies and bridge the gaps between HNT and the SOL token. We already created and tested the token and even itegrated it to the Phantom wallet. Phantom is the most widely used Solana wallet and through our Protocol we also created a bridge to swap these two assets through it. Here are some screens and transactions that have taken place:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VNfVt05/obolelele.png" width="500">

You can find OBOL here:

https://explorer.solana.com/address/6XYRoRykEKjfdv94jgt4b9bkLgQfoTYjGcCx1WXAh7mm?cluster=devnet

Or through this address:

6XYRoRykEKjfdv94jgt4b9bkLgQfoTYjGcCx1WXAh7mm

Of course, we are pending merge to get our OBOL ticker, name and Symbol:

If you could please integrate it to your own Phantom wallet, we will be testing and sending some around in the coming days for several Proof of concepts.

# Market analysis

According to Cisco, over the next decade, the logistics industry, with the implementation of IoT, is likely to generate USD 1.9 trillion, as a result of unlocking higher levels of operational efficiency. This is considering the fact that IoT connects millions of shipments in real time. With its strong manufacturing and transportation and logistics base, North America offers significant potential to asset management technology providers. Furthermore, the governments in the region contributed to increasing the need for asset management in the region. For instance, in the US transportation and logistics sector, the Federal Highway Association (FHWA), along with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and state and local departments of transportation (DOTs), has been encouraging the application of asset management.

Overall, technologies, such as RFID, sensors, location-based technologies, and integrating software, and the recent IoT implementation have been serving the needs of asset management. Factors, such as e-commerce and the increasing industrial assets due to Industry 4.0, have been promoting the asset management market.

Asset Tracking Market was valued at USD 17.14 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach USD 34.82 billion by 2026 at a CAGR of 13.45% during the forecast period 2021 - 2026.

<img src="https://inkwoodresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/edd/2020/10/Asset-Tracking-Market.jpg">

Reference: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/34-82-billion-asset-tracking-markets---global-growth-trends-covid-19-impact-and-forecasts-report-2021-2026--301320916.html

Now let's analyze the growth of the web3 decentralized model for hardware based infrastructure in (you guessed it!) the Helium Network.
Helium Network is the fastest-growing wireless network, decentralising connectivity and expanding access to the internet worldwide. Fewer than two years since the Network's launch, it has achieved global adoption with more than 230,000 Hotspots deployed across 20,000 cities worldwide. Giving an incentive in the form of tokens to those that sustain the network.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/yVyhPKP/helium.png">

The model works and with the rising needs for asset tracking, more so cold chain asset tracking the decentralized model is almost tender for adoption, it just needs a solution.

# Potential impact for the Solana ecosystem.

The project is still in its early stages, but we already have an almost ready-to-launch project at hand! We invite you to test it as it is COMPLETELY functional. Of course our weaknesses are around the edges as we need some help regarding tokenization and fundraising but we think that this project has a great potential in becoming THE bridge between Solana and Helium. Probably a third integration with Arweave might be at hand, as data loads become bigger and Helium is looking at 5G integration. The impact regarding the Solana ecosystem is huge, as it merges the ideals of a Nasdaq-speed blockchain architecture with the enourmous infrastructure that the Helium Network has, with its more that 230,000 Longfi hotspots around the world and solves the woes that IoT normally has without a blockchain implementation. Adding to that, with our Swap platform we also bring liquidity between two growing blockchains that didn't had much in common beforehand.

# Go to Market Strategy, Business Model and Roadmap

The Hackathon is not over for us, as soon as public voting opens (Oct 18th) we will expand on our social networks (we have been doing that for some time now) and reach as far as we can with the project. that will set us a base to operate from and follow up with more development and further up our roadmap.  

We plan on incorporating the same business model (at first) that Ubidots, AdafruitIO and other incumbents follow, with heavy inspiration also on how the Helium blockchain and how it manages its device subscription. Of course, every Decentralized model requires incentives and for that we have the OBOL token. Following projects like Planetwatch: https://www.planetwatch.io/ we can incorporate in a future version mining through sensors, this is where a third integration with Arweave (https://www.arweave.org/) makes sense, as the amount of data will increase and the load to be stored. In essence integreating Solana's speed, the Helium Network's infrastructure and Arweave's decentralized storage would bring forth an incredible project powered through sensor mining incentives.

Before that our immediate roadmap is as follows:
